#Your PI says: "Hey we have a collaborator who has fallen off the face of the earth. We did a cool brain study and all that's left is the data analysis. I remember you took that Python class, so you're a data analysis expert, right? Also if you analyze these data you can graduate early."

#Your PI tells you the study was looking at brain responses when participants hear correct and incorrect grammar. You do a little bit of research and decide that you're going to analyze event-related potentials (ERPs).

#Your overall goal is to plot ERPs from all participants individually and an overall average; ERPs should be reactions to (1) syntatically-acceptable sentences vs (2) sentences with syntax errors. You decide for now you'll just analyze the Australian English sentences. Hint: Start with plotting data from the Cz electrode, from one participant.

 

#For this assignment, do the following:

#Create a github account
#Fork Dr. Cler's repository: https://github.com/gabecler/SPHSC525_2024Links to an external site.
#Use ChatGPT to get started. Commit the first try with ChatGPT to your repository. Continue to commit periodically when you have a working version.

#When you are finished, submit to me:

#Link to your (public) repository with your final code
#A ~1 page summary of your results:
    #Plot of ERP from Cz for one participant, average of sentences without errors and average of sentences with errors. X-axis should be time and y-axis amplitude. Negative amplitude on y-axis can be down or up (EEG convention), but should be marked. X-axis should have 0 marked as onset of error.
    #Plot of average ERP from Cz for ALL participants, average of sentences without errors and average of sentences with errors.
